      <h1>What is this?</h1>
      <p1>This is part of a project I have been working on since march of 2025 where I am makeing my own 3D printer from scratch. I want this to be a much cheeper version of a 3D printer that what is currently on the market because if you ask me most printers are extreamly overpriced. This is the RassberryPi/3D printer side side. <a href = https://github.com/christiffervogts/Chris--3D-printer-computer
> This is the link to the computer side of this</a>. The Printer is not a design that I have seen anywhere before so maybe it's a bad idea or maybe it's too difficult for companies to mass produce either way I think that I am a good enough engnieer to get it good and working. The design is based off of a 6 axis arm. There will be 6 stepper motors and 6 TMC2209 drivers controlling the arm. I belive that the reason this is not a common design is because there are thre "extrenious" axes and we have over doubled the size of calculations. However I have found a work around for doing these laborious calculations to find where the arm should be at any given point. Like most FDM printers the print bay will be contained to a small area in our case a 3 by 3 by 3 foot cube. Once at initial start up the arm will walk through the cube and write down the angles for the motors at every 5mm mark. Then after a few hours of marking points and angles the computer will have a few million points to work with and we can simply use a small Trilinear interpolation algorithm to find the remaining angles. Example: I need to move the nozzle to the point (231.652, 192.77, 18.2534). well the two points that I will interpolate between are (230, 190, 15) and (235,195,20). since these points are know in the file we can just interpolate the six angles of the motors to get the correct angles for that point.  </p1>
    <h1>What is needed?</h1>
This is a link to the Bill of materials. I am also willing to sell a pre-assembled model for 250 USD as I understand that this is slightly more expansive then the entrey level printers that other companies make however this is a heigh quality design that is entierly open source and with the detachable head other activitys are cabible of being done with just the one perchace.
